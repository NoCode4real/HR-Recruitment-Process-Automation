# HR Recruitment Process Automation

## Objective
Designed and modeled an automated HR recruitment process to reduce time-to-hire and improve efficiency.

## Tools
- Lucidchart (BPMN diagrams)
- PostgreSQL (data analysis)
- Excel (data cleaning)
- Power BI (dashboard)
- JIRA (project tracking)

## Deliverables
- **Requirements Document**: Captures personas, user stories, and gap analysis (see Requirements_Document.docx).
- **BPMN Diagrams**: As-Is and To-Be processes (see Recruitment_Process_AsIs.png, Recruitment_Process_ToBe.png).
- **Data Analysis**: SQL queries on HR data (subset in hr_data_subset.csv).
- **Dashboard**: Visualizes recruitment insights (see HR_Recruitment_Dashboard.pbix, HR_Recruitment_Dashboard.pdf).
- **JIRA Board**: Tracks project tasks (see JIRA_Board.png).

## Impact
- Identified manual screening bottleneck (5 days) and proposed ATS automation, reducing to 1 day.
- Analyzed recruitment sources to prioritize high-performing channels.

## Dataset
Based on Kaggle HR Dataset[](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rhuebner/human-resources-data-set).
